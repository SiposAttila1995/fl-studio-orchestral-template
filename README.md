The reason for the 2 playlist arrangement is that some people like to use automation, others like events. Feel free to mix them actually.

If you want to have the template in the FL Studio menu, follow these steps:
1. Close FL Studio.
2. Put the BBCSO Core.nfo and BBCSO Core.flp files into the FL Studio User Data folder, located here by default:
`c:\Users\username\Documents\Image-Line\FL Studio\Projects\Templates`
3. Open FL Studio, go File / New from template, it should be listed.

Spitfire Audio recommends storing the sample library on SDD.

Take care!
